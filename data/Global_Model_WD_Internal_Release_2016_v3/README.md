Copy the deforming model data (2016_v3) here before running the workflow.

There should be a directory "Global_Model_WD_Internal_Release_2016_v3" with ".gpml" files (for topological plate and deforming networks) and some ".rot" rotation files, as well a "StaticGeometries/" sub-directory (that should also be recursively copied).
