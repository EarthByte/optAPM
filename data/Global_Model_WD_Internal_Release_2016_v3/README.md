Copy the deforming model data (2016_v3) here before running the workflow.

Earthbyte has a "EByteDeformingModels" repository that should have a directory "Global_Model_WD_Internal_Release_2016_v3" with ".gpml" files (for topological plate and deforming networks) and some ".rot" rotation files (as well a "StaticGeometries/" sub-directory, etc). Easiest is to copy everything in that directory into this directory (so that this directory has the '.gpml' and '.rot' files).
